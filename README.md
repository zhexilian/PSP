+ **We introduce a novel physical-informed modeling paradigm to enhance physical plausibility of predictions.** 
+ **We explicitly model interactions between vehicles for enhanced vehicle trajectory prediction explainability.** 
+ **We propose a sparse learning framework to learn the prediction model efficiently.**  

# Getting start
## Installation
Clone this repo firstly:    
```Python
git clone https://github.com/zhexilian/PSP.git
```
Create the virtual conda environment using the `environment.yaml`:    
```Python
cd PSP/
cd src/
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate 25ITSC
```
## Data processing
This is a NGSIM data processing method for trajectory prediction and planning. The original NGSIM data is transformed to numpy frames (.npz). Each frame contains the ego vehicles' history trajectory, the nearby N agents' history trajectories, the map features and the ground truth of future trajectories. Firstly, you need to decompress pre-processed data in folder "original_data/". There is a csv and it is collected from https://github.com/Rim-El-Ballouli/NGSIM-US-101-trajectory-dataset-smoothing.  
To run data processing:
```Python
cd PSP-Physical-informed-Sparse-learning-for-interaction-aware-vehicle-trajectory-Prediction/
mkdir original_data/   #where the data should upload to
mkdir processed_data/
cd src/
python utils/data_process.py
```
The data processing log will be printed through your terminal.

## Training
Chang settings as you wish in `src/config/config.yaml`  
Create new folderï¼š  
```python
cd ..
mkdir log/
mkdir checkpoints/
```
Train the model:  
```Python
cd src/
python train.py
```
This script will train the model for **five times** with five different random seeds.  
The **training log** will be saved in `log/`.  
The model **checkpoints** will be saved in `checkpoints/`.  
## Testing  
Create new folderï¼š  
```Python
cd ..
mkdir test_results/
```
Testing:  
```python
python test.py
```
The **testing results** will be saved in `test_results/`
