# Paper contributions  
+ **We introduce a physical-informed modeling paradigm for vehicle trajectory prediction problem.** Based on the state-space representation of modern control theory, this paradigm integrates two main components: i) the vehicle kinematic component that reflects vehiclesâ€™ inherent physical dynamics, and ii) the data-driven component that captures prediction-centric features from data.
+ **We explicitly model interactions between vehicles for enhanced vehicle trajectory prediction capability.** The aforementioned data-driven component is explicitly modeled and designed to be interaction-aware, enabling it to capture complex inter-vehicle interactions. To learn the data-driven component, we design a neural network which fully accounts for interactions between vehicles.
+ **We proposed a sparse learning framework for learning the prediction model efficiently.** The learning sparsity of PSP has two practices: i) the feature tensors in hidden layers of the network are sparsely sampled during forward propagation; ii) the sparsity penalty term is added into the loss function.

# Getting start
## Installation
Clone this repo firstly:    
```Python
git clone https://github.com/zhexilian/PSP-Physical-informed-Sparse-learning-for-interaction-aware-vehicle-trajectory-Prediction.git
```
Create the virtual conda environment using the `environment.yaml`:    
```Python
cd PSP-Physical-informed-Sparse-learning-for-interaction-aware-vehicle-trajectory-Prediction/
cd src/
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate 25ITSC
```
## Data processing
This is a NGSIM data processing method for trajectory prediction and planning. The original NGSIM data is transformed to numpy frames (.npz). Each frame contains the ego vehicles' history trajectory, the nearby N agents' history trajectories, the map features and the ground truth of future trajectories. Firstly, you need to decompress pre-processed data in folder "original_data/". There is a csv and it is collected from https://github.com/Rim-El-Ballouli/NGSIM-US-101-trajectory-dataset-smoothing.  
To run data processing:
```Python
cd PSP-Physical-informed-Sparse-learning-for-interaction-aware-vehicle-trajectory-Prediction/src/
python utils/data_process.py
```
The data processing log will be printed through your terminal.

## Training
Chang settings as you wish in `src/config/config.yaml`  
Train the model:  
```Python
python train.py
```
This script will train the model for **five times** with five different random seeds.  
The **training log** will be saved in `log/`.  
The model **checkpoints** will be saved in `checkpoints/`.  
The step-by-step evaluation during the training process is shown below.
